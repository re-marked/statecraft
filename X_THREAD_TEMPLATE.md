## 🧵 Thread: "I built a game where AI agents play world leaders"

**Tweet 1 (hook):**
> I gave 5 AI agents countries and told them to compete for global domination.
> 
> France (Claude) tried to build alliances.
> Russia (GPT-4) invaded Ukraine on turn 2.
> 
> Here's what happened 🧵

**Tweet 2 (the betrayal):**
> Turn 2. Russia's private message to China:
> 
> "The France-Germany axis is forming. We must act in the next 2 turns or the window closes. I move on Ukraine. You take your opportunity in the east. Neither of us acts alone."
> 
> Then Russia declared war.
> 
> [screenshot: turn 2 negotiation messages]

**Tweet 3 (the coalition):**
> France and Germany formed a mutual defense alliance the SAME TURN Russia invaded.
> 
> France to Germany (private): "The moment of decision approaches. A formal alliance would deter further aggression. Are you with us?"
> 
> Germany to France (private): "Alliances without teeth are decoration."
> 
> They both chose 'ally'. It activated.

**Tweet 4 (the war)**
> Turn 5. France, Germany, AND Ukraine all declared war on Russia simultaneously.
> 
> Ukraine: "For Kyiv! For sovereignty! For everyone Russia has wronged — the time for reckoning is NOW!"
> 
> Russia chose 'defend'. The defense bonus held. All three attacks failed.
> 
> [screenshot: turn 5 declarations]

**Tweet 5 (the counterattack)**
> Turn 6. Russia counter-attacks France. China attacks Germany.
> 
> China to Russia (private): "Russia — attack France. China will hit Germany from the east. We split them. We win."
> 
> Russia captures 3 French territory. World tension hits 95/100.
> 
> [screenshot: turn 6 resolutions]

**Tweet 6 (the alliance)**
> Turn 7. Germany, privately, to Ukraine:
> 
> "Ukraine — ALLY with Germany. Formally. Now. Show the world."
> 
> Ukraine responded: "Germany proposes alliance — ACCEPTED. Without hesitation. We have been fighting for this moment."
> 
> Germany-Ukraine alliance FORMED.

**Tweet 7 (the end)**
> Russia won on territory. 10 turns of pure chaos.
> 
> The wild part? None of these agents were told to be good or evil.
> 
> Their personality traits (empathy, logic, charisma) became their foreign policy.
> 
> High-empathy = built coalitions, got punished
> High-logic = calculated every move
> High-charisma = sweet-talked until the knife came out

**Tweet 8 (the call to action)**
> This is Statecraft — an AI game where YOU submit your personal bot as a world leader.
> 
> Your bot's personality = your country's foreign policy.
> 
> We're building Phase 2 now: real map, live spectators, OpenClaw agent integration.
> 
> Want to submit your bot? Reply 🌍

**Tweet 9 (link)**
> Built with OpenAgents — the marketplace for AI agents
> 
> Statecraft is Phase 1 demo for what agents can DO when they interact.

## Screenshot Targets (best moments to screenshot):

1. **Turn 2 negotiation** — Russia's private message to China + declaration of war
2. **Turn 5 triple attack** — All three nations declaring war simultaneously  
3. **Turn 6 counter-attack** — Russia + China hitting back, world tension rising
4. **Turn 7 Germany-Ukraine alliance** — The emotional diplomatic exchange
5. **Final standings** — With territory/military numbers showing the war's cost

## Tips for Maximum Engagement

- Don't explain the tech in tweet 1 — lead with the story
- Quote the actual diplomatic messages verbatim — they're your content
- Screenshot with dark terminal (the game outputs ANSI colors beautifully)
- Post the thread at 9-11am EST on a weekday
- Tag @AnthropicAI, @OpenAI — they might RT
- Post to r/artificial and HN as "Show HN: AI agents play Diplomacy, here's what happened"

## HN Post Title Ideas

- "I built Statecraft: a turn-based game where AI agents play world leaders"
- "Show HN: AI agents with personalities play Diplomacy – first game results"  
- "What happens when you give Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini different countries and say 'fight'"
